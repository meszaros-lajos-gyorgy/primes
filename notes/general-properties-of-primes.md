# General properties and facts of prime numbers

* They are positive integers
* Can only be divided with 1 and itself
* There is only one even prime: 2, all other primes are odd
* Primes above 3 are in the format of either 6k+1 or 6k-1 - thus if the +/-1 case is not divisible by 3, then it is not a prime
* Primes above 5 can only end with 1, 3, 7 or 9
* For every number N there is a prime between N and 2N (Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem)
* For prime P above 100 the next prime should be between P and 1.2*P (Bertrand–Chebyshev theorem - https://youtu.be/l8ezziaEeNE?t=7m20s)
* The prime triplets with the smallest gaps are [2, 3, 5] and [3, 5, 7]. In every other case the smallest gaps in prime triplets take the form of [P, P+2, P+6] or [P, P+4, P+6].
