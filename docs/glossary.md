## Primes

This is a list of consecutive primes within a given range.

## Interval

A range of numbers between n and m. The individual numbers contained within the range is not important, only the n and m as markers for the beginning and the end of the range.

It is not required for an interval to contain primes, but primes need to be attached to an interval, even if that interval only contains that prime and nothing more.

If multiple intervals come in touch with each other or overlap based on their beginning and end, then they need to be combined into a single interval.

## Base

A special case of intervals, which always has it's starting point at 0. This gives home to all the lower primes, which tells us how far we can check the primality of numbers without having to find new primes.
